# moldableOrthopedicProstheticGeneration
Leveraging a novel thermal workflow, algorithmically generated moldable orthotic and prosthetic solutions with superior functionality and comfort.

Employing the gyroid minimal surface as the principle structural element, the resulting devices are highly moldable, agnostic of axis. Due to the accessible thermal characteristics of popular thermoplastics, healthcare providers and patients are able to form a custom shape that hardens in seconds and can be remolded following subsequent heating just as quickly. Coupled with elastic plastics such as TPU, cushioned areas complement the rigid molded structure for comfort and control.
