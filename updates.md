### New Thermal Molding Workflow - January 24, 2024

Through testing of full-sized models, I have developed a new thermal workflow for molding of From prosthetic devices. First, the inner diameter of the device is widened using a tool capable of high-strength radial expansion. The device is then cooled in the expanded form and placed on the patient. Finally, a secondary heat source is used to reheat the device in-place. The second heat softly returns the socket to its original position, forming exactly to the residual limb.

### Form Prosthetic Socket V2 Developed - February 15, 2024

With my learnings from the original prototype, the new thermal molding workflow, and the invaluable experience of 2ft Prosthetics, I am pleased to announce Form Prosthetic Socket V2. This iteration has improved high-temperature resistance, a modified geometry for superior rigidity, and is natively compatible with hardware and silicone sleeves from ST&G Corporation. This model is currently undergoing a comprehensive evaluation by 2ft Prosthetics.  


### Partnership with 2ft Prosthetics - January 11, 2024 

I am overjoyed to announce the beginning of a partnership with 2ft Prosthetics, a nonprofit organization that serves amputees in underprivileged regions. One of the organization's engineers and I will continue the development of my moldable prosthetic socket and orthotic solutions and evaluate them for practical use.


### Completion of Orthotic and Prosthetic Generative Algorithms - November 8, 2023

Today marks the completion of the generative algorithms for my orthotic and prosthetic solutions. Users may now use the software workflow --- fully outlined on the documentation page --- to generate the digital model of their medical aid from only images of their anatomy.
